<p><font color="white">She ain’t my brethren,
But she is smbdy I care about there is no question,<br>
I tried to study her but couldn’t afford paying for the tuition,<br>
She passes by then she captures my attention,<br>
And to these lines she is the motivation,<br>
Continuation...
</p>
</font><p><font color="red">
Mercy,<br>
In her teens but beautiful as her birth,
<br>Hotter than a dragon’s breath,<br>
Sweeter than rose scents,<br>
Super independent she ain’t got time for no nonsense<br>
</p>
<p>
Though I don’t know her that well,
If I live to see my grandchild then her story I would tell</font><br></p>
